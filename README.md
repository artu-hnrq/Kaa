 A truly python, package development empowerer

[`Kaa`][PyPI] is a Python package made to simplify Python packing flow, providing some useful development and deployment features. Check [package description](DESCRIPTION.md#kaa) for more information and [examples](DESCRIPTION.md#Example).


## Getting started
Make sure you have at least [Python 3.6 installed][0]:
```
$ python3 --version
python 3.8.2

Since, from this version, [pip][1] already comes together with Python, you'll be able to download package [latest release][PyPI] available in PyPI:
```
pip3 install kaa
```
